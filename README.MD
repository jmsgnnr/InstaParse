```py


This is the beginning of an application that will parse your downloaded instagram message json files and create an easy to read table of all of your messages 

We will write it in python and also we will create a few different methods of achieving our flattened json data -> User interface connection 

One of these files contains a python script that will send our messages to an html file for seamless web browsing

Another will parse our data, clean it, and send only our text to a database for analytics

Eventually, I'd like to add a script using madplotlib to run visual analytics on some fun metrics found in my convo.

Happy coding!!!!!!
